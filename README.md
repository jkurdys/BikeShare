# Kurdys BikeShare Project

## Objective: 
    - predict net rate of bike rentals for a give station *rate defined as (trips ended - trips started) / hr
        - expect that the primary factors influencing rate will be:
            - time of day
            - weather
            - station location
            
## Execution
    - notebook walkthrough provides data preparation and code for wrangling into csv flat file
    - link to EDA in Tableau included in notebook along with path to future integration with weather data
